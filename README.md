# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game constructed through Python. This game is terminal based.
The Tic tac toe board is displayed with the key mappings identical to that of a numeric keyboard in a full sized keyboard.
Initially player X is asked to enter the position where he will leave 'X' on the board.
Next player Y is allowed to choose and leave a mark on the board.
Both players are not allowed to overwrite each other's preselected positions. In that case, they are prompted to choose again. While a warning is displayed after the colon on the title line. 
Winning condition is achieved by placing one players symbols (either X or Y) contiguously along the horizontal plane or vertical plane or diagonally (i.e three successive cells marked with same symbols).
